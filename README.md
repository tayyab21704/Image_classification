# Image_classification
 This project features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow's Conv2D layers to recognize and classify various fruits and vegetables from images. The model effectively captures features through multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by dense layers forÂ classification.
